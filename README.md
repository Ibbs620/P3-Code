# P3-Code
Code for Project 3 of ENGINEER 1P13 at McMaster University.

This program uses a Raspberry Pi to control a robotic arm and terrestrial drone within the Quanser Interactive Labs simulation software to control a recycling sortation system to deposit containers into the correct bins.

A grade of 100% was acheived on the final submission and a bonus activity which involved modifying the program for use with a physical robot was also attempted and completed successfully.
